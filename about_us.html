      <h2>Our Story</h2>
       <p>Welcome to <em>babyvelsbakes</em>. Our name is inspired from a childhood nickname (Baby Vel) and the venture started as a hobby and eventually grew since it was founded in 2016. The love of baking grew from childhood memories making banana bread at the weekend, combined with the creative freedom of making new designs.</p>

       <p>Over the course of a year, the <em>babyvelsbakes</em> family grew from close friends to a network of over 400 lovers of blueberry banana bread, brownies and personalised cakes. All of the baking was done at home and usually alongside revision for my second year at college, but nonetheless all of the smiles at collection made every minute spent worth it.</p>

       <p>Thanks to CodeFirst: Girls, <em>babyvelsbakes</em> as a team of three we (Maxine, Julia and Antigoni) were able to create this website, which we all hope you love as much as we do.<p>

       <p>Big love,</p>
       <p>Maxine.</p>
